# Script: wipe_external_macos.sh
# Purpose: Securely wipe all externally connected removable storage devices on macOS
#
# Usage:
#   1. Save as wipe_external_macos.sh
#   2. Make executable: chmod +x wipe_external_macos.sh
#   3. Run with root privileges: sudo ./wipe_external_macos.sh
#
# What it does:
#   - Detects external (non-internal) disks via diskutil
#   - Confirms before wiping each drive
#   - Unmounts volumes on the disk
#   - Uses dd to overwrite disk with random data and zeros
#
# Notes:
#   - Targets *external* disks only
#   - Wiping is destructive â€” confirm before running
